# Clifford Project

This is a Novel Visualization Project.

What is this project meant to solve?
In the modern day, books/novels/readings are too time consuming, for this fast paced life style.
Books give off the sense of dullness.
Books can be too hard or too complicated in their nature to fully understand.

This project will help someone quickly understand the relationships in whatever is is that they are reading.
This will provide a reading assist tool for users.

(Plotting a Novel)
(Reverse Engineering The Plot of Novels)

This is a project that has been brewing in my mind.
This is a language understanding project.

Clifford was one of the first books I've ever read in English.
It was really the first book that cemented my understanding of the English Language.

I plan to use "clifford" to model a better understanding of the written word.
The book generates infographics on the fly as the book is narrated or passed along to the reader.

## Ideas

Grammar - the english language can be broken down into the parts of speech
e.g. Maybe Chomsky

Each sentence is diagramed.

## Graph Visualization

Each Idea will be Graphed
Nouns - Graphed As Vertex
Relationships will be graphed

Mind Map
Imagination assist tool

## Current Research - Launch Pad

Really, the idea is that AI will be able to assist someone build the visualization as they are going through the book
  - Books are drab.
  - Most people I know, do not want to sit down and go read a book, but what if we made it interactive?
  - Using AI we can build a live visualized way to consume writing
  - I am the type of person who goes and reads books sequentially, word by word,
    - the machine can use this method and build the visualization word by word as it goes
