# Clifford Project

Clifford is a Text Visualization Project.

As the Internet continues to expand, reading textual information becomes less and less attractive. People are swarmed with an ever increasing amount of text as they attempt to process and model the world around them. Clifford is framework for visualizing the content of text at a glance. Clifford aims to leverage the advances in ML Natural Language to make understanding the world simpler for people.

### GPT NEO

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](./gpt_neo/GPTNeo.ipynb)

GPT_NEO is a ML model used to generate text. This is a "free" and open source project by EleutherAI.

### OpenAI

OpenAI has a beta which people can access using an API key to generate text.
## About

The name Clifford is inspired by the first book I read as a young child - "Clifford, The Big Red Dog". This was the first book I personally checked out from my elementary school library and the first book I read on my own accord, without adult supervision or guidance. This book launched me on my path of curiosity.

My hope is that this software can bring the same sentiment to its users - to open the door of curiosity and enable people to explore the wonders of books, stories, and the written text.

## FAQ

Q:
What is this project meant to solve?

A:
In the fast paced lifestyle of the modern day, enjoying a raw text novel is too time intensive.
The goal of this project is to enrich the reading process so that novels are as "drab" as they appear to be.

Q:
What is the design philosophy behind this project?

A:
I take myself back into the days of children's picture books.
The richness of picture to go along with the understanding of the text truly lit a spark in my understanding of the world.
It was really the first time I understood the concept of "language"
As we grow up, the text-block based nature of more "adult" literature becomes intimidating.
It requires from the reader both a vivid imagination and an abstraction [^mental_model] model, to grasp at what is being conveyed.
This project aims to assist readers of all levels understand their text better.

[^mental_model]: A Mental Model (The Mind's Eye); without such a model, it is IMO impossible to read and understand something

Q:
What kind of intuition will be required to realize this project from conception to actualization?

A:
One needs to think about reverse engineering the plot of the story.
On technique for reading a complicated novel is to diagram it, this project aims to assist the reader in doing that.
The texts that people as consumers read are the finished product.
Plot-line, Story Boards, Chapter Outlines, Topic Inspirations etc. are all missing from the final product (in most cases).
This project aims to reveal all of the hidden layers behind the scenes while the reader is reading to enrich the process.

Q:
Why is this important?

A:
Enrich the Means of Communication
Assists Understanding
Promotes Literacy

Q:
What is the engineering effort?

A:
Creation of an AI Literature Mentor - An AI (Primary School Educator) that can explain everything as if the reader is 5
  - * Degree of Scaling (The Presentation can be scaled based on the level of the reader)
Creation of a Machine Assisted Processes
  - Children's Book Illustration
  - Infographics
  - Language Diagrams
Create Graphics on the Fly as the narration advances

Q:
What other questions are most frequent about this project?

A:
The frequency of 1, lolz...

## Ideas

Grammar - the english language can be broken down into the parts of speech
e.g. Maybe Chomsky

Each sentence is diagramed.

Natural Language Processing (NPL)
  - Machine Learning Applications

## Graph Visualization

Each Idea will be Graphed
Nouns - Graphed As Vertex
Relationships will be graphed

Mind Map
Imagination assist tool

## Current Research - Launch Pad

Really, the idea is that AI will be able to assist someone build the visualization as they are going through the book
  - Books are drab.
  - Most people I know, do not want to sit down and go read a book, but what if we made it interactive?
  - Using AI we can build a live visualized way to consume writing
  - I am the type of person who goes and reads books sequentially, word by word,
    - the machine can use this method and build the visualization word by word as it goes
